# RestApi with almost all balckpink songs + photos. 
 i am planning nothing fancy at all, just some educational project for creating backend
 
 I am going to use: 
 1) postgreSQL
 2) frontend will be done on Flutter (may be, it will be cute small mobile app)


i am from app mobile development field and I have never done anything related to backend.
